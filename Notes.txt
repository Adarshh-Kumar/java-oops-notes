Second:
IMP:All this theory is because Java gets confused about which method to call in non static without instance.

We can't access a non static method from a static method coz
static methods belong to the class and non-static methods belong to an object (instance)
so to call a non-static method from a static method you need to have an owner i.e. obj.greeting();
Note that u can call static from non-static

static void fun(){
greeting();
}
                       NOT ALLOWED as above is static and below non-static and it dosent know where and what is he calling

void greeting(){
Sysytem.out.println("Hello");
}



//Calling a nonstatic from a nonstatic
In this the hey will be called using the instance of obj created in static indirectly using this as a reference to obj

static void lap(){
    Main obj=new Main();
    obj.greeting();
}
void greeting(){
    hey();
}

void hey(){
System.out.println("Hey");
}





Q:this in static : The this keyword cannot be used in static methods
1): static methods are not associated with any specific object.
2):this means current object
3):static belongs to the class



Q:Outside classes can't be static and only nested classes can be static
2): static means “does NOT depend on any object.”
1): Top-level classes cannot be independent of a file / package context in that way.


Q:On what does the class in every java code is dependednt on abpve psvm since it's not static
1): Top-level classes NEVER depend on objects.
2): They depend on the JVM + ClassLoader, not on another class.


Note...
1): Static classes,satic variables and all has nothing to with the object
2): Objects are created at the run time.
3): Hence static are resolved at the runtime


Let's understand : Working of some statements
1):System is a class
2):out is a variable    (out is a variable type PrintStream which has a println method which is just calling that)
3):println is a method  (calculates valueOf using some function/method and which call toString method)
4): dot after each is to bind instance variable with reference methods(like we had this.name=name)
5):Printing the simple object that is Sopln(obj): It will call toString if not present in the class of this obj then will call default printing classNamw@HashValue



Q:For a class when only one instance or object is allowed to be created
A:Singleton Class: To make a class Singleton, ALL 3 rules must be followed:
1): Private constructor
2):Private static instance variable(static → one per class    ,    private → cannot be modified outside)
3):Public static access method     public static Singleton getInstance() {return instance;}
